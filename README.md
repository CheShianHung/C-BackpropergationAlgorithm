# C-BackpropergationAlgorithm
The program implements backpropagation algorithm in C++ to train the network to classify three classes. Each sample is represented as a three-dimensional vector, and there are 30 samples that are randomly generated for each class. The data set is different every time the program runs. In this way, we can fully test the trained network with various dataset.
